<p>
I keep most information about me centralized under
<a href="http://john.colagioia.net">my own domain</a>, if you happen to be
looking for more.
</p>
<p>
If, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re here for
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>>-type material, I could
recommend&hellip;
<ul>
<li>The most useful thing I&rsquo;ve written is
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/uManage">uManage</a>, a local time
tracker for the Linux desktop.  I have also gotten a lot of use out of
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/ClassManagement">ClassManagement</a>,
a set of scripts I use to my classes and lecture notes.</li>
<li>Small programming language implementations, including
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/Klickenklacker">Das Klickenklacker</a>,
an attempt to clean up the Rube 2-D language,
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/PosTuring">PosTuring</a>, based on the
Post-Turing machine,
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/Prim">Prim</a>, based on Primitive
Recursive functions,
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/Thue">Thue</a>, a minimalist language
based entirely on rule-based string substitution, and
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/Wierd">Wierd</a>, a simple 2-D language
with no explicit commands or data.  If you have a DIY attitude (since the
working version seems lost to history), there&rsquo;s also
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/SiliconAda">SiliconAda</a>, the
Ada-to-VHDL compiler I wrote for my Master&rsquo;s thesis, back in the day.
</li>
<li>There are a few toys that the right person could probably turn into a
reasonable project, including
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/CityAutomata">CityAutomata</a>, a
stripped-down cellular automaton to tinker with city planning ideas,
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/Keywords">Keywords</a>, a first pass on
validating claims in texts by searching for prominent words,
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/Markov">Markov</a>, generic code to
manage Markov processes,
<a href="https://github.com/jcolag/VerdigrisGenes">VerdigrisGenes</a>, a
very quick experiment in genetic programming that wasn&rsquo;t terrible,
</li>
</ul>
